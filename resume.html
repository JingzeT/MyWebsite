  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <hr />

  <h4>Online shopping platform</h4>
  <h5><em>React, Context API, Express.js, Stripe, Firebase, Bulma</em></h5>
  <div class="centerbox">
    <p class="inbox">
      1. Built an Amazon-style e-commerce application which allows users to register and login their accounts, browse items
  shown on pages and add them to the shopping cart and checkout with various online payment methods.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      2. Built user-friendly front-end application with React and Bulma. Besides, Context API was used to manage global
  variables instead of using Redux and the useful data were stored in Cloud Firestone and JSON files.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      3. Established the back-end server with Express.js and generated a set of restricted keys for Stripe with Stripe Cli.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      4. Implemented authentication and online payment with Firebase and Stripe respectively, securely listened to requests
  from Stripe using webhooks and saved customers’ multiple payment methods information for future use.
    </p>
  </div>

  <br /><br />


  <h4>Students Community Application</h4>
  <h5><em>React, Redux, Express.js, Axios, MongoDB, Material-UI</em></h5>
  <div class="centerbox">
    <p class="inbox">
      1. Built an online community that provides students with managing accounts, editing profiles and posting functionalities.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      2. Designed front-end web pages to directly manage accounts, profiles and posts using React. Redux was used to integrate
  global state, Ajax requests were sent using Axios and Material UI was applied to beautify the appearance.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      3. Established the back-end server using Express.js and save client data in MongoDB cloud supported by AWS with
  Mongoose in Node.js. Provided services to create, edit and delete profiles and posts using RESTful API.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      4. Managed the version using Git and deployed the program on Heroku after API testing with Postman and building.
    </p>
  </div>

  <br /><br />


  <h4>Project Tasks Manager</h4>
  <h5><em>React, Redux, Axios, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT, Testing</em></h5>
  <div class="centerbox">
    <p class="inbox">
      1. Built an app to help users manage their projects effectively with separate front-end app and back-end service. Users can
  create, edit, delete tasks and label them with 3 categories: to do, in progress, done and 3 priorities: low, medium, high.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      2. Front-end: Built simple web pages to illustrate clear layout of project manager functionalities using React. Flexibly
  centralized state used in different components with Redux and decorated the layout and appearance with Bootstrap.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      3. Back-end: The server was established using JAVA with Spring Boot to connect with MySQL, handle asynchronous
  requests sent using Axios in the front-end and respond using RESTful API. Additionally, JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  and Spring Security were used to control users’ authorizations and improve the security of authentication.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      4. Fulfilled unit and API test to the project, deployed after testing and building and performed maintenance of the project.
    </p>
  </div>

  <br /><br />


  <h4>Data Prediction and Image Classification</h4>
  <h5><em>R, Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Neural network</em></h5>
  <div class="centerbox">
    <p class="inbox">
      1. Task 1: Predicted the trend of assessed values of houses in the next year using the given data with R. Performed linear,
  lasso and ridge regressions with the data which exceeded the correlation coefficient threshold and made comparison.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      2. Task 2: Established a neural network to classify 21 types of wild life using given images with Keras in Python.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      3. Divided the dataset into training and validation sets, implemented data augmentation and then built the 7-layer network,
  selected proper optimizer, loss function and trained the model. The training and validation accuracy were 0.8 and 0.65.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      4. Improved the model in 4 steps: adding augmented data, tuning learning rate, adding layers and unlocking same layers in
  inception. Updated the model to a 10-layer network. Eventually, The two accuracies climbed to 0.85 and 0.75.
    </p>
  </div>

  <br /><br />


  <h4>FMCW radar system in Linux</h4>
  <h5><em>FMCW radar, Linux, GNU Radio, Range-doppler FFT</em></h5>
  <div class="centerbox">
    <p class="inbox">
      1. Built a radar system using GNU Radio in Linux to simulate and generate FMCW signal to detect moving targets.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      2. Saved reflected signal data in files and calculated relative velocity and distance of the moving target with EMD
(Empirical Mode Decomposition), wavelet denoising and Range-Doppler FFT algorithm using MATLAB.
    </p>
    <p class="inbox">
      3. The achievement was that the average accuracy of the detected velocity and distance reached 90% and 96%.
